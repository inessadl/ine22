                        Iâ€™m a Product Designer based in Porto Alegre, Brazil. I'm currently working at Thoughtworks, in a very collaborative team. I believe that transparency, collaboration and diversity are the keys to build an awesome product. When I'm not designing, I like to ride my bike and explore new places. I'm fueled by music and art, always willing to discover new artists.
