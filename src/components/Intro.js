                        Iâ€™m a Product Designer based in Porto Alegre, Brazil. I'm currently working at Thoughtworks, in a very collaborative team. I believe that transparency, collaboration and diversity are the keys to build an awesome product.

                    <p>
                        I have a Bachelor Degree in Computer Science, but I also took many classes of Graphic Design and Fine Arts in the University. I started my professional career as a Motion Designer followed by a Front-end Developer and now I'm an Experience Designer, working with digital products.

                        When I'm not designing, I like to ride my bike and explore new places. I'm fueled by music and art, always willing to discover new artists.
